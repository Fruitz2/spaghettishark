      "description": "Nobody knows how it happened. One moment, a great white minding his business. The next? Ankle-deep in angel hair. Some say it was fate. Others blame the Italians. Either way, there's no going back."

      "emoji": "🍝",
      "title": "The Problem",
      "description": "Turns out sharks and carbs? Dangerous combo. This apex predator now spends more time at Olive Garden than hunting seals. Marine biologists are concerned. The shark doesn't care."

      "title": "Get Serious (Maybe)",
